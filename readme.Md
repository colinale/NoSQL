# Unit 17 NoSQL Homework: Workout Tracker


During the Regex challenge, I had the opportunity to learn about Regex and and how it functions. I learned how I can built a system that allows other systems and applications to "talk" to one another.  During this challenge I had reach out to some peers for clarification and reviewing class time zoom, notes, and modules was able to help me understand the concepts better. I was able to become a little more familiar with what's going with a bit of a struggle and more practice I get the more I will learn. programs are becoming more familiar as time goes on and the practice we're given is also helping.
